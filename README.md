## 🗃️ Database Design
### Key Entities:
1. **Users**
   - Fields: id, email, password, first_name, last_name, phone, created_at
2. **Properties**
   - Fields: id, owner_id, title, description, price_per_night, location, created_at
3. **Bookings**
   - Fields: id, user_id, property_id, check_in_date, check_out_date, status
4. **Reviews**
   - Fields: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, created_at
5. **Payments**
   - Fields: id, booking_id, amount, payment_method, status, created_at

### Relationships:
- A **User** can have multiple **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** belongs to one **Payment**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews** from different **Users**.

## 🛠️ Feature Breakdown
- **User Management**: Registration, login/logout, profile updates.
- **Property Management**: Add, update, delete, and view listings.
- **Booking System**: Reserve properties, manage dates and statuses.
- **Payment Processing**: Handle transactions securely.
- **Review System**: Leave and view property reviews and ratings.

## 🔒 API Security Overview
Key security measures implemented:
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or Token-based authentication.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting API requests per user/session.
- **Data Encryption**: SSL/TLS for secure communication.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injections.

Security ensures that user data, financial transactions, and internal operations remain safe and private.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline Overview
### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment. It automates the testing and deployment process to ensure code changes are reliable and quickly delivered to production.

### Why it's important:
- Ensures code quality before merging.
- Speeds up the release cycle.
- Reduces human error during deployments.

### Tools used:
- **GitHub Actions**: For running automated tests and workflows.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring environment consistency.
- **Deploy Platforms**: Such as Heroku, AWS, or any cloud provider.
